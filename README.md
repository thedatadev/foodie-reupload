# Foodie (re-uploaded)

### NOTE:
Foodie was made for a university project along with four other group members. This repo only contains the artefacts that I worked on for the project. I also worked on the chatbot agent's conversational design which is documented under the "chatbot_diagrams" directory as a collection of diagrams. The chatbot was implemented using Dialogflow.


## Description
A chatbot which helps users live a healthier lifestyle by providing them nutritional information to help them make better dietary decisions. The chatbot is accessible from social messenger applications such as Facebook messenger.


## Features

#### Food diary
The user can maintain a log of what they eat and look up their calorie consumption at any time.

#### Food classifier
Food can be identified from text using entity-extraction as well as from images using image recognition.

#### Calorie lookup
Retrieve nutritional information about food such as calories and nutrients.

#### Food report
Generate on-demand reports about personal calorie consumption for a given timeframe.


## Challenges
This project initially involved user privacy management but we pivoted late into the semester and had several weeks to implement Foodie. The reason for the pivot was due to the sheer difficulty in implementing the credential management service we had initially envisioned.
